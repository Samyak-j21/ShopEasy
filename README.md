# My ShopEasy Website 🛍️
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my ShopEasy website. I built this to put my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to the test by creating something that looks and feels like a real-world site. It's a front-end-only project, so the focus was all on the user experience and making everything look and work just right.
✨ What's Inside?
I was really focused on a few key things when I was building this:
A Solid Foundation: I used HTML and CSS to get the look and feel down, making sure it's fully responsive. It should look good on everything from a huge desktop screen to your phone!
Interactive Fun: All the buttons and features you see—like adding items to the cart—are powered by my JavaScript code.
Testing, Testing, Testing: To make sure everything was working perfectly, I used the Jasmine framework to test all the JavaScript logic. It was a great learning experience!
🚀 Getting It Up and Running
Want to take a look? It's super easy to get started!
Clone this repo: Grab a copy of the files and save them to your computer.
Open in VS Code: Fire up Visual Studio Code and open the project folder.
Use Live Server: Go to the file explorer, find shopease.html, right-click on it, and select "Open with Live Server".
That's it! The Live Server extension (which I highly recommend!) will pop open the page in your browser, and you'll get live updates as you explore the code.
