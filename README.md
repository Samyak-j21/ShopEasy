 ## My Amazon Clone Project 🛍️
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Amazon clone. I built this as part of a fantastic JavaScript course from SuperSimpleDev. It was an awesome way to put my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to the test by creating something that looks and feels like a real-world site. It's a front-end-only project, so the focus was all on the user experience and making everything look and work just right.

✨ What's Inside?
I was really focused on a few key things when I was building this:

A Solid Foundation: I used HTML and CSS to get the look and feel down, making sure it's fully responsive. It should look good on everything from a huge desktop screen to your phone!

Interactive Fun: All the buttons and features you see—like adding items to the cart—are powered by my JavaScript code.

Testing, Testing, Testing: To make sure everything was working perfectly, I used the Jasmine framework to test all the JavaScript logic. It was a great learning experience!

🚀 Getting It Up and Running
Want to take a look? It's super easy to get started!

Clone this repo: Grab a copy of the files and save them to your computer.

Open in VS Code: Fire up Visual Studio Code and open the project folder.

Use Live Server: Go to the file explorer, find amazon.html, right-click on it, and select "Open with Live Server".

That's it! The Live Server extension (which I highly recommend!) will pop open the page in your browser, and you'll get live updates as you explore the code.

✍️ About Me
I'm a self-taught developer who's passionate about building things. I created this Amazon clone while taking a full-stack course from SuperSimpleDev. This project was a major step for me, and I'm really proud of how it turned out!
